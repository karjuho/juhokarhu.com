## Starting small

Sanna used to send emails to her clients with youtube links. That was a hassle, she started to realize people would watch videos even if they were not paying, the manual invoicing was a mess and when the clients started to be around a hundred. It was a bottleneck that hindered expansion. It was at this time Sanna turned to us.

I took the lead of the project and fast forward a few years and we have built a full-fledged SaaS solution for Sanna. The company grew from only around 100 subscribers to thousands. Sanna did not anymore have to deal with manual payments as our new Stripe integration handled everything automatically, the weekly email schedules were now sent automatically, and in the app, you could follow your progress on workouts, weight, measurements, active days and so on.

### My part

During this project, we were still a really small team and I had to wear many hats. In this project, I did most things myself. I handled the client and structured meetings. I did the initial strategy and database structure together with my colleagues. Then I did prototypes and UI and coded both the front-end and the back end. My college helped with the Stripe payments and checkout flow. After the project launched I have been the main person to update and maintain the code. I added new features and fixed bugs.

## Taking the next step

We did everything you would expect from the app, based on what Sanna had already been doing: weekly workout plans, courses a workout library and stuff like that. And that alone would have been awesome. But in addition we have developed the environment to include stats, levels and a unique inWell Pulse motivation system. These extra features have helped users to stay motivated.

## Emails automated

When reciving a weekly email, its important to recognize the sender. So naturally we styled the weekly emails, password resets and other emails with the same simple and clean style as the app.
