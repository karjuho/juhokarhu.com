excerpt: In 2020 you should be able to experience things online before you buy them. But configurators are hard and expensive. That's why we built a configurator maker based on a subscription model!

## Buying a house can be scary
Buying a house can be super scary. Buying it online can be super scary. We made it possible to experience your home before you even sign up for anything. Making it less scary and super fun to look at houses!

It started with a house making a client asking us to make a webshop for their houses. They already had wireframes from a local ad agency with a typical webshop layout that did not exactly feel inviting. The client wanted us to explore how would the next generation, online first experience look like. We came up with a configurator combined with transparent pricing. This was back in 2016, and since then many other house makers have followed and we got more requests so we decided to build a configurator maker.

### My part

I had a somewhat shared lead on this together with my boss. I took responsibility for the look and feel with prototypes and UI. I then together with the developers coded it. I coded mostly the looks (HTML/SCSS), while my skilled colleagues wrote the algorithms for image processing.

## The power of dreaming

When you play around with a configurator you really can imagine yourself with the project. The configurator is built in a way where you can sit down with your partner and dream about your new house. Jumping from room to room and fine tune the details. It's like playing The Sims, only it's your real house!

## Hot leads

Of course, the leads that come through a configurator might not be that many. But after dreaming about their house imagine how prepared they are to buy when they finally are ready to make contact. That's why we made it simple to look at your selections and send them directly to a seller. 

I know even cooler would be to directly sell the house with transparent pricing, but the house maker industry is not quite there yet. I tried, but I am sure it will come!
